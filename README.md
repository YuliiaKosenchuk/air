## ✨ Features
- Interactive Background: A unique system of floating geometric shapes that react to mouse movement using a parallax effect powered by motion/react.

- Staggered Animations: All content elements appear sequentially ("waterfall effect") upon loading and scrolling to create a premium feel.

- Pixel-Perfect UI: Precise implementation of Figma designs, including specific corner radii and border thicknesses for various object scales (Large, Medium, Small, Tiny).

- Adaptive & Responsive: Fully responsive from UltraWide monitors to smartphones. On mobile devices, complex background animations are intelligently disabled to preserve performance and battery life.

- Modular SCSS: Utilizes a modern styling architecture with Mixins, Variables, and BEM-like nesting for maintainability.
